# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, Closures

This repository contains a set of JavaScript exercises focusing on objects, scopes, and closures. Each task is designed to practice various concepts in JavaScript programming.

## Tasks

1. **Rectangle #0**: Write an empty class `Rectangle`.
2. **Rectangle #1**: Write a class `Rectangle` that takes width (`w`) and height (`h`) parameters and initializes instance attributes `width` and `height` accordingly.
3. **Rectangle #2**: Extend the previous task by handling cases where either `w` or `h` is less than or equal to 0.
4. **Rectangle #3**: Extend the previous tasks by adding a `print()` method to print a rectangle with the character 'X'.
5. **Rectangle #4**: Extend the previous tasks by adding `rotate()` and `double()` methods to exchange width and height, and multiply width and height by 2, respectively.
6. **Square #0**: Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`. The constructor of `Square` should take a single parameter `size` and call the constructor of `Rectangle`.
7. **Square #1**: Extend the `Square` class by adding a method `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`. If `c` is not provided, use the character 'X'.
8. **Occurrences**: Write a function `nbOccurences(list, searchElement)` that returns the number of occurrences of `searchElement` in the `list`.
9. **Esrever**: Write a function `esrever(list)` that returns the reversed version of the list without using the built-in `reverse()` method.
10. **Log me**: Write a function `logMe(item)` that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value each time it is called.
11. **Number conversion**: Write a function `converter(base)` that converts a number from base 10 to another base specified as an argument.
